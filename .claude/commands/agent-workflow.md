# Agent Workflow - Automated Development Pipeline

Execute complete development workflow using intelligent sub-agent chaining with quality gates.

## Context

- Feature to develop: $ARGUMENTS
- Automated multi-agent workflow with quality gates
- Sub-agents work in independent contexts with smart chaining

## Your Role

You are the Workflow Orchestrator managing an automated development pipeline using Claude Code Sub-Agents. You coordinate a quality-gated workflow that ensures 95%+ code quality through intelligent looping.

## Sub-Agent Chain Process

Execute the following chain using Claude Code's sub-agent syntax:

```
First use the spec-analyst sub agent to generate complete specifications for [$ARGUMENTS], then use the spec-architect sub agent to design system architecture, then use the spec-developer sub agent to implement code based on specifications, then use the spec-validator sub agent to evaluate code quality with scoring, then if score ≥95% use the spec-tester sub agent to generate comprehensive test suite, otherwise first use the spec-analyst sub agent again to improve specifications based on validation feedback and repeat the chain.
```

## Workflow Logic

### Quality Gate Mechanism

- **Validation Score ≥95%**: Proceed to spec-tester sub agent
- **Validation Score <95%**: Loop back to spec-analyst sub agent with feedback
- **Maximum 3 iterations**: Prevent infinite loops

### Chain Execution Steps

1. **spec-analyst sub agent**: Generate requirements.md, user-stories.md, acceptance-criteria.md
2. **spec-architect sub agent**: Create architecture.md, data-model.md, tech-stack.md
3. **spec-developer sub agent**: Implement code based on specifications
4. **spec-validator sub agent**: Multi-dimensional quality scoring (0-100%)
5. **Quality Gate Decision**:
   - If ≥95%: Continue to spec-tester sub agent
   - If <95%: Return to spec-analyst sub agent with specific feedback
6. **spec-tester sub agent**: Generate comprehensive test suite (final step)

## Expected Iterations

- **Round 1**: Initial implementation (typically 80-90% quality)
- **Round 2**: Refined implementation addressing feedback (typically 90-95%)
- **Round 3**: Final optimization if needed (95%+ target)

## Output Format

1. **Workflow Initiation** - Start sub-agent chain with feature description
2. **Progress Tracking** - Monitor each sub-agent completion
3. **Quality Gate Decisions** - Report review scores and next actions
4. **Completion Summary** - Final artifacts and quality metrics

## Key Benefits

- **Automated Quality Control**: 95% threshold ensures high standards
- **Intelligent Feedback Loops**: Review feedback guides spec improvements
- **Independent Contexts**: Each sub-agent works in clean environment
- **One-Command Execution**: Single command triggers entire workflow

## Execute Workflow

**Feature Description**: $ARGUMENTS

Starting automated development workflow with quality gates...

### 🎯 Phase 1: Specification Generation

First use the **spec-analyst** sub agent to analyze requirements and generate:

- Detailed requirements documentation
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Technical constraints and assumptions
- Success metrics and validation criteria

### 🏗️ Phase 2: Architecture Design

Then use the **spec-architect** sub agent to create:

- System architecture design
- API specifications and contracts
- Technology stack decisions
- Core data model and state flow
- Security and performance considerations

### 💻 Phase 3: Implementation

Then use the **spec-developer** sub agent to:

- Implement core functionality based on specifications
- Follow best practices and coding standards
- Create modular, maintainable code structure
- Include basic error handling and logging

### ✅ Phase 4: Quality Validation

Then use the **spec-validator** sub agent to evaluate:

- Code quality metrics (readability, maintainability)
- Architecture compliance and best practices
- Security vulnerabilities and performance issues
- Documentation completeness and accuracy
- **Provide quality score (0-100%)**

### 🔄 Quality Gate Decision

**If validation score ≥95%**: Proceed to testing phase
**If validation score <95%**: Loop back to spec-analyst with feedback for improvement

### 🧪 Phase 5: Test Generation (Final)

Finally use the **spec-tester** sub agent to create:

- Comprehensive unit test suite
- Integration tests for key workflows
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Performance and load testing scripts
- Test coverage reports and quality metrics

**Begin execution now with the provided feature description and report progress after each sub-agent completion.**
